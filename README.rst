Dir Signature
=============

:Status: Alpha
:Documentation: http://docs.rs/dir-signature/


This crate allows to create a signature (index) of a directory with files,
which is:

* Reproducible (does not depend on order of file scan)
* Easy to check even using a bash script (sans edge cases)
* Usable for file synchonization
* Can be produced and checked without loading full index into memory
